 *
 * This program intends to implement the specified game and program behavior: A
 * strongly-connected digraph is drawn on an imaginary game board, and a marker
 * is randomly moved along the edges until all nodes have been visited. Each
 * node counts the number of times it has been visited, and some statistics are
 * produced after the game completes.
 *
 * The words "node" and "circle" are used interchangeably. Also, the words
 * "arrow" and "edge" are used interchangeably.
 *
 * FILES: An input file containing a description of a strongly-connected digraph
 * must be supplied and named 'HW1infile.txt' in the current working directory.
 * A transcript will be produced in the file 'HW2fillaOutfile.txt'. These files
 * are considered mission critical, so I/O errors may cause early termination.
 *
 * INPUT FILE FORMAT: The input file must conform to a strict textual format:
 *   - One line containing the integer number N, the number of circles (nodes)
 *   - One line containing the integer number K, the number of arrows (edges)
 *   - K lines, one edge (arrow) per line, containing two integer numbers each
 *       - The first integer number, per line, is the source circle number
 *       - The second integer number, per line, is the destination circle number
 *
 * The program will make a good faith effort to identify issues in formatting;
 * however, not every pathological input file has been tested.
 *
 * GOOD INPUT FILE EXAMPLE:
 *  4
 *  5
 *  1 2
 *  2 1
 *  2 3
 *  3 4
 *  4 1
 *
 * In this example, four circles are described (N=4 on the first line). Five
 * arrows (K=5 on the second line) are to be provided by the five following
 * lines. The third line prescribes an arrow from circle 1 to circle 2, the
 * fourth line prescribes an arrow from circle 2 to circle 1, and so on.
 * Gameplay can proceed without error.
 *
 * BAD INPUT FILE EXAMPLE:
 *  4
 *  5
 *  1 2
 *  2 1
 *  2 3
 *  3 4
 *
 * This is an example of a bad input file whose formatting issues will be
 * identified by the program. As you can see, five arrows are prescribed (K=5 on
 * the second line), but only four are defined in the lines that follow. The
 * program will abort on account of premature EOF.
 *
 * TODO: Add an example of a bad input file because not strongly connected.
 *
 * INTERNALS: The program represents each circle (node) as a record with three
 * members: Number, Marks, and Arrows. The Number integer associates each circle
 * with its numeric index (starting with 1, not 0). The Marks integer counts the
 * total number of checkmarks placed on the circle. The Arrows member is a
 * dynamic array of pointers to other circles. Each arrow is represented in
 * memory as a pointer to the destination node stored inside the source node.
 *
 * Basic statistics are kept in global variables as the game progresses. These
 * include tallies on total- and uniquely-marked circles, as well as a counter
 * for the total number of checkmarks drawn (visits made) overall.
 *
 * NOTE: All program output, less unhandled exceptions, is mirrored to the
 * output file via a custom "MyWriteLn" function that composes two "WriteLn"
 * calls. I wished to find a redirection system in Pascal similar to C++'s
 * std::ios::rdbuf(...), but I was unable to. My final solution is less elegant,
 * but it works.
